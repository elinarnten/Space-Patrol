# About Game

The game is built in TypeScript with Canvas and p5.

This game takes place in space where dangerous asteroids are threatening our planet. You will be positioned in a spacecraft. Your weapon is a laserbeam. Save our planet by shooting down asteroids with the laser. 

Beware of the bombs: once you shoot on them, you will lose points. Aim carefully.


Each level goes on time. You must meet the current number of meteorites to survive and to reach the next level. 

Use the following keys:
ESC - Menu
P - Pause
ENTER - Start game
SPACEBAR - Shoot
